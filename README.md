# ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE DEMO VIDEO**

The demo video included in this repository is **not fully representative of the scope, depth, and engineering effort** that went into this project.

The recording was created as a brief submission artifact and does not showcase:

- Architectural design decisions
- Internal system logic
- State management complexity
- Debugging and optimization work
- Iterative refactoring and structural improvements
- Edge-case handling

The visible output in the video reflects only a surface-level demonstration of the project’s capabilities.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Cortisol is a system designed with an emphasis on:

- Modular architecture  
- Scalable structure  
- Clean separation of concerns  
- Iterative engineering refinement  
- Performance-aware implementation  

A significant portion of the effort focused on infrastructure, system design, and internal logic rather than visual presentation alone.

## 🏗️ Technical Highlights

- Structured component hierarchy  
- Organized state flow  
- Clear abstraction boundaries  
- Incremental development via version control  
- Emphasis on maintainability and extensibility
