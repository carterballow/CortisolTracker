## 🧠 Project Overview

Cortisol is a system designed with an emphasis on:

- Modular architecture  
- Scalable structure  
- Clean separation of concerns  
- Iterative engineering refinement  
- Performance-aware implementation  

A significant portion of the effort focused on infrastructure, system design, and internal logic rather than visual presentation alone.
